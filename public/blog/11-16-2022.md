# Wishlist: Asynchronous Highlighting #

I wish Visual Studio Code would highlight asynchronous code. 

For example, it's silly but I recently had a problem with a hook returning an undefined state because
a promise hadn't yet returned. If our IDEs highlighted asynchronous code it would have possibly tipped
me off sooner to my mistake.

Likely I just need more experience as a developer, but I wonder if asynchronous code highlighting wouldn't
help others debug more efficiently.

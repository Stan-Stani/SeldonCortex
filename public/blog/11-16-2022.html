<h1 id="wishlist-asynchronous-highlighting">Wishlist: Asynchronous Highlighting</h1>
<p>I wish Visual Studio Code would highlight asynchronous code. </p>
<p>For example, it&#39;s silly but I recently had a problem with a hook returning an undefined state because
a promise hadn&#39;t yet returned. If our IDEs highlighted asynchronous code it would have possibly tipped
me off sooner to my mistake.</p>
<p>Likely I just need more experience as a developer, but I wonder if asynchronous code highlighting wouldn&#39;t
help others debug more efficiently.</p>

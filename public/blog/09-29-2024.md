# Darwin Doesn't Care if You're Happy; Social and Romantic Fulfillment

I noticed recently, I tend to focus more on romantic fulfillment than social fulfillment. But I believe that I would be a happier and healthier person if I focused more on social fulfillment over romantic fulfillment, not even counting that if I were more socially fulfilled, romantic fulfillment would be more likely to follow.

Why then does my mind/body prioritize romantic fulfillment over social by default?

I can think of two main reasons, both of which seem to follow from evolutionary theory:

- Traditional human social structures were more likely to result in social fulfillment, so a person would benefit more from focusing on the romantic than something that was already fulfilled. That traditional social structure was around long enough to affect our evolution.
- Someone who did not reproduce, no matter how socially fulfilled they were, would not contribute whatever biological factors contributed to their focus on the social to the detriment of the romantic/sexual.

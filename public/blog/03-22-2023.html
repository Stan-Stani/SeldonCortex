<p>So many people talk in months and years of their lives but don&#39;t indicate how many hours they were putting in per day, which I find inexact and unhelpful. I&#39;ve believed this for a number of years, I think primarily due to the fluentin3months article: <a href="https://www.fluentin3months.com/hours-not-years/">How to learn a language in hours, not years</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I understand everyone&#39;s aptitude, circumstances, and job are different, but I&#39;d still like to try to find some sort of average. Please include classroom hours as well if you are not completely self-taught.</p>
<h3 id="heres-my-answer-to-the-question">Here&#39;s my answer to the question:</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>I finally got my first offer for a Junior Dev position, which I snapped up. I&#39;m completely self-taught when it comes to coding, but had dabbled on and off since middle school. I got serious about web dev a couple years ago and because I keep pretty good track of my hourly learning/project time I can say it took me about 600 hours to get the offer, but maybe I was ready at 450 / 500?</p>
<p>But an undergrad CS course is approximately 120 credit hours which I&#39;ve read is approximately equal to 360 total hours of class + homework. But bear in mind that an undergrad course isn&#39;t just CS credits and I myself have a Liberal Arts BA. Which might make one think it should have taken me less than 360 total hours to be job ready.</p>

<p>P.S. To anyone who intends to reply that counting hours like this is pointless, I respect your opinion but I will add: </p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am interested in trying to find some sort of average. I know that people&#39;s ability and opportunity vary and that human beings are extremely complex and hard to quantify oftentimes, but I feel like it&#39;s worth trying.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#39;s a futile task.</p>
